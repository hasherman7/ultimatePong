# ultimatePong
This project started out as a simple assignment in CSC 103 to create pong, but then became a personal project of mine that ended as Pong: The Fighting Game
The controls go as follows:
'q' can be used to start the game from the start screen and restart the game, taking you back to the start screen
The spacebar can be used to pause the game and is also used to start the ball
Player 1 uses WASD to move
Player 2 uses the arrow keys to move
Keys 'e' and '0' are used to challenge (Positioned at the top right of player controls, with 0 being on the number pad)
When you challenge, the game state changes to the fighting mode in which the paddles start beating the crap out of each other.
's' and the down arrow are used to punch for players 1 and 2 respectively
